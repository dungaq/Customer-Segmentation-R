# 🛒 Customer Segmentation with PCA & K-Means (SmartFresh Retail Case)

This project applies **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**, and **K-Means Clustering** in **R** to segment retail customers.
It is based on the *SmartFresh Retail Case Study* completed during my MSc Business Analytics at the University of Birmingham.

## 📊 Project Overview

* **Objective:** Identify customer segments to optimize marketing campaigns and improve retention.
* **Dataset:** Retail customer demographics, spending patterns, and shopping channel usage.
* **Techniques used:**

  * Data cleaning & preprocessing (outlier capping, missing value imputation, feature engineering).
  * Statistical tests: Levene’s test, t-tests for variable selection.
  * Dimensionality reduction: PCA (capturing \~82% variance in 4 components).
  * Segmentation: K-means clustering (optimal k = 3, evaluated by silhouette score).

## 📈 Key Results

* **Three clusters identified:**

  1. **High-Income Broad Spenders** → Premium engagement strategy (VIP programs, early access).
  2. **Budget-Conscious Promotion Seekers** → Coupon campaigns, in-store loyalty discounts.
  3. **Selective Online Luxury Shoppers** → Online luxury positioning, influencer marketing, personalized digital offers.
